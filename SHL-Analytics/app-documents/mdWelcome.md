Simulation Hockey League Visualization Tool
===========================================

Welcome to an Analytics Tool for the [Simulation Hockey
League](https://simulationhockey.com/index.php). The SHL is a forums
based simulation hockey league where players from all around the world
create and develop players.

About the tool
--------------

This tool reads data from the forums’ index and with the different tools
allows for deeper insight into the data.

It is still a work in progress and more functions will be added on as
time goes on. If you are interested in helping out or want to know more
about the work, contact

Players
-------

The *Players* tab ranks all players based on their earned TPE split by
their draft class.

Visualizations
--------------

Under this tab you will find two types of visualizations. The first
allows you to view a radar chart of a player’s ratings. The second looks
at the similarities of players in the league, and projects these
similarities in a two-dimensional plot. You can also select single or
groups of players to visualize their attributes in a radar chart.
