```

*This text is here to explain the process of how you should take and package screenshots from the game. It is very important to follow these instructions as the tool looks for specific names in the files and positions in the screenshot.*

## FHM Setup
In order for the image recognition to work you will need to provide 1440x900 resolution screenshots of dark text on a white background.

### The white background
What this means is two things; first you will need to select the default skin (*fhm*) in the main settings under **Current Skin**.

```{r, out.width = "100%"}

"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/798581854370398269/873996903648473168/unknown.png" %>% 
  knitr::include_graphics()

```

Second you will need to change the default picture, as can be seen above, from the arena to a blank white image. This image can be found in the installation path of your game, so if you have it installed via Steam the path would be: `.../steamapps/common/Franchise Hockey Manager 6/data/skins/default/images` and the file `game_background_main.png`. The image to replace needs to be 1900x1200 pixels in size in order to provide a white background inside a saved game:

```{r, out.width = "100%"}

"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/798581854370398269/873998069149073570/unknown.png" %>% 
  knitr::include_graphics()

```

Remember to close the game when you are changing the files and restart the save once everything is done.

### The resolution
The final step in the setup is to change the game to *Windowed* **Display Mode** and the **Window Size** to *1440x900* and as can be seen in the earlier screenshot.

## Creating the screenshots
If you are using Windows then you are in luck as the process of creating screenshots is very easy. Other operative systems might have similar tools but as long as the screenshots cover the entire window of the mentioned size, you're good to go.

### Using Windows Game Bar
Using the command `Win + Alt + Print Screen` you will take a screenshot of the currently active window you are viewing. 

The shortcut `Win + G` opens up the Windows Game Bar where you can see in the *Capture* menu where your screenshots will be saved. 

### Screenshot 1 - top
The first screenshot that you need to take and save as `top.png` is the top of a boxscore.

```{r, out.width = "100%"}

"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/798581854370398269/873230722519932958/unknown.png" %>% 
  knitr::include_graphics()

```

This is one of the easier screenshots to take as you just scroll up as far as possible.

### Screenshot 2 - away
The second screenshot that you need to take and save as `away.png` is the player stats for the away team. Make sure that you scroll to a position where you get the header row as close to the top of the viewing window as possible, similar to:

```{r, out.width = "100%"}

"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/798581854370398269/874001522126635048/away.png" %>% 
  knitr::include_graphics()

```

### Screenshot 3 - home
Do the same for the home team, `home.png`, and move the scroller so that the header row is positioned on top of the viewing window:

```{r, out.width = "100%"}

"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/798581854370398269/874001542099914842/home.png" %>% 
  knitr::include_graphics()

```

### Screenshot 4 - bottom
The fourth and final screenshot, `bottom.png`, is the goalie and team information at the bottom of the boxscore which you get by scrolling as far down as possible:

```{r, out.width = "100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/798581854370398269/874001555672686612/bottom.png")

```

## Zipping the screenshots for upload
The final step is to create a `.zip`-file out of the four (4) screenshots you have taken. Then you can upload the file in the menu to the left.
