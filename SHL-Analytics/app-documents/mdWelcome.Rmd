# Simulation Hockey League Visualization Tool

Welcome to an Analytics Tool for the [Simulation Hockey League](https://simulationhockey.com/index.php). The SHL is a forums based simulation hockey league where players from all around the world create and develop players. 

## About the tool

This tool reads data from the forums' index and with the different tools allows for deeper insight into the data. It is recommended to use the tool at a minimum 1280x1040 resolution. 

It is still a work in progress and more functions will be added on as time goes on. If you are interested in helping out or want to know more about the work, contact [Canadice](https://simulationhockey.com/member.php?action=profile).

## Draft Class Rankings
The *Draft Class Rankings* tab ranks all players based on their earned TPE split by their draft class. It also includes information about their bank account, their activity status and more. 

## Visualizations
The kit offers many different visualization tools for different purposes:
- First you can visualize a player's attributes with the help of a radar chart. 
- The second creates *player cards* based upon standardized regular season statistics.
- The third looks at the similarities of players in the league, and projects these similarities in a two-dimensional plot. This visualization is interactive so you can select single or groups of players to visualize their attributes in a radar chart and compare more in detail. 

## Careers
The current career tool offers some aggregated statistics for players in the SHL (and some from the SMJHL).
