Simulation Hockey League Visualization Tool
===========================================

Welcome to a visualization tool for the [Simulation Hockey
League](https://simulationhockey.com/index.php). The SHL is a forums
based simulation hockey league where players from all around the world
create and develop players.

About the tool
--------------

This tool reads data from the forums on a weekly basis and with the
different tools allows for deeper insight into the data sets. It is
still a work in progress and more functions will be added on as time
goes on. If you are interested in helping out or want to know more about
the work, contact
