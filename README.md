## TODO

- Boxscore scraper:
  - Add editable field for game and team info
  - Organize how uploaded and edited data is saved. Using the schedule as a framework should work.
- Add activity visualizer that looks at the Activity checks and player updates.
- Add league and position averages to the player attributes visualizer.
- Add button for league records per game/relative stats as well as total stats.
- Create function to add budget information to players from [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EgWsNTbveHdG9knS_4i1h9j2yGQivQr8TlU9Dc1aVoI/edit#gid=263507878)
